## how to make struts from sticks...
#### craft, that is..

What you will need to get started: 
sticks, glue, and 36 degrees

__Stop!__ wait, I can't go on with _needs_. glue, jigs, bevels, attachments, do-hingy hongies.  _Need, need, need_.

The 99% persperation. Er, exasperation...

#### What we _really_ need are the learnings along the way.
</Card>

<Card image="/src/lib/space-struts/IMG_2285.jpeg" heading="Dead Ends" >

It has taken months of plodding mistakes, attempts, materials, crafting, cajoling to reach the simplicity of the current simplified Space Struts that you are aboout to see.

##  __Some things that didn't work:__
   <Card heading="*Sewing:*" image="/src/lib/space-struts/IMG_2006.jpeg"><p>The 2D placement of patterns drove the seamstress wacko.  I can see why the mainstream art has shied away from Penta tiles for masonary. Also the 3D structures were really hard to sew.</p>
</Card>

<Card heading=" *Drilling Locator Holes:*" image="/src/lib/space-struts/IMG_2300.jpeg" >
<p>The mathematics is clear: the holes need to be placed at critical spots that are dictated by the Golden Ratio. (que choir).  So, we drilled tiny holes at exxactly those points.  Bad implementation: deviations in the placement meant lots of rejects and bad fitting models.  These early models had enough internal stress that they soon crumbled.</p>
</Card>
<Card heading="*Large craft sticks:*" image="/src/lib/space-struts/IMG_2333.jpeg" alt="Large sticks form the skeleton of a tetrahedron" ><p>I thought they would be easy to work with, but they were not cost effective. The strength wasn't as good, and the glue we were using did not give solid joins.<p>
</Card>
<Card heading="*Small craft sticks:*" image="/src/lib/space-struts/IMG_2393.jpeg" alt="small sticks did not fit well." ><p> They were easier to work with, especially since we switched away from drill holes for alignment.  Still, the thickness of the sticks created crowding and misalignment for 3D structures.</p>
</Card>
    -    *Super Glue:* Cyanacrilic glues stick too well for long, long, minutes after application.  No touch!
    -    *Hot Melt Glue:* Gooey, hard to keep in place during cooling, and prone to lots of spludges and spider webs.
    -    *Most glues for paper:* The old standby had no 'tack' during assembly.  parts would slde apart too easily.

-  __Some things that did seem to work:__
    -    *full size 6 inch sticks:* Round corners help assure the circle of contact is exact. the thickness is reduced compared to the neighbooring struts so misalignment is reduced.
    -    *Depending on angles rather than exact lengths:*  This one was rather surprising, since western tooling has been most excellent at getting length measurements down to the tiniest possible.  It seens that errors in the placement would add up as an assembly was put together, causing it to not quite fit.  When we switched to simply depending on the sticks themselves to have a consistent length, we shifted to making as perfect angle of 36 degrees with two sticks.  The result?  any errors in the angle of these guys would tent to averge out over a larger structure.  The result always got the point across.

-  __Some Things That Still Need Improving:__
   -   _hinges:_ Most office tape sticks too much or doesn't stretch.  Duct tape is too wide and makes a mess to work with.  Maybe something with balloon animal balloons.
   -     _hook and loop tapes:_ Finding the right amount of hold versus removability is the key.  By repeated application/removal, the question remains: How many times can I do this before the whole thing falls apart.  After all, it's not welded rebar, it's just craft sticks and easy peasy glue.
