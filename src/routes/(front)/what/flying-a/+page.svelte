p The Flying-A is good for two things: It gives the exact locations to glue the cross pieces for the Golden Triangle.  Since it is made from two equal gnomon triangles, the lengths of the long sides are exactly right.

p Other than that, it has no use in either two or three dimension construction, except for cool outer space shadow battles on the wall.

p it also might work as a tractor wheel.
