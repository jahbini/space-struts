p GG, widely known as the Golden Gnomon, is an obtuse triangle with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees.  The sides are in the mathematical ratio know as, what else, the Golden Ratio.  It is unique in that the ratio is maintained when two lengths add up to a multiple of both. Very unique.  An addition that maintains a relationship. Forever.  Smaller or bigger.  The magic bridge between addition and multiplication. infinitely... in 60 directions.

p it also might work as a tractor wheel.
