    h5 The story as told by Gimo Beamo
    p.
      It all started with the Great Dodecahedron and the Golden Triangles,
      the #[a(href="what/GG") GG] and #[a(href="what/GT") GT].
      The #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_dodecahedron") Great Dodecahedron]
      are those shapes at the right and left at the top.
      All the faces are made up of GG triangles.  Fascinating, as Spock might say.
    p.
      Even more fascinating is the fact that these Golden Gnomons can be split up
      into smaller pieces that always leave smaller GGs and GTs.

    p.
      Life had been good in outer space.  Good?  no. Great.  The freedom to roam the universe went to our heads.
      What do you call it? Ah, Car Bone, a simple combination of protons and newtrons that form a perfect PrincessT.
      Ah, sweet love of my life, PrincessT.
