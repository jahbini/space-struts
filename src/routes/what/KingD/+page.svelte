p This rigid structure is made with 12 Golden Triangles, and 24 Golden Gnomons. This structure is made from six Huts pointing outward. Even though the hut has a square footprint, it fits very well in the Dodecahedron's cube symmetry.

p The golden triangles are forced to participate in all the verticies of a dodecahedron made from huts.  Other variants have three Gnomons at six corners.
