<h3> You have reached the gateway to <a href="./explore/triangle-city">Triangle City</a>, a prototype of the future.</h3>

<p>The population of vertex city lives at the points of the Platonic solids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron">ref#wikipedia</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
Step 1: Select one or more of the Solids
</li>
<li>
Step 2: Add some line segments by length and select triangles by angles from them.
</li>
<li>
Step 3: remove the vertices or labels if you want
</li>
<li>
Step 4: Gaze at the left and right views of your triangle city.  3D viewing is easy for some, hard for some: don’t hurt yourself.
</li>
<li>
Step 5: rotate the left view to get the full 3D effects.
</li>
<li>
Step 6: If you want to save your images, just click the links under each view: you will get an exact SVG image of your city.
</li>

Step 7: Sign the <a href="./explore/fire-jim">“Fire Jim”</a> petition (King D. made me put that in)
