<h3>King D sez: A Prophesy </h3>

<p>Fire this guy!  Only YOU are competent enough to fulfull this Vision that I, King D, planted in the brain of the gullible Geemo Beamo.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, that will be easy.  Just give him any reason to sign this whole shebang over YOUR competent hands.

That's why there is a Contact button on the page.  Use it.
</p>
<p>
Respectfully,
The Honorable and Most Majestic
</p>
<h4>King D</h4>
